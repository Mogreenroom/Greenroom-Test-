Absolutely, I can provide you with an example of how you might create a basic recruitment CRM in Salesforce using Apex (Salesforce's programming language) and custom objects. This example assumes you want to track Candidates and Jobs.

Creating Custom Objects:
Start by creating two custom objects in Salesforce: Candidate and Job.

Go to Setup → Object Manager → Create → Custom Object.
Create fields for each object (e.g., Candidate Name, Email, Phone, Job Title, Job Description, etc.).
Apex Classes:
Now, you'll need Apex classes to handle the business logic. For this example, we'll create a simple class for creating a Candidate and Job.

apex
Copy code
// CandidateController.cls
public class CandidateController {
    public static void createCandidate(String name, String email, String phone) {
        Candidate__c newCandidate = new Candidate__c();
        newCandidate.Name = name;
        newCandidate.Email__c = email;
        newCandidate.Phone__c = phone;
        insert newCandidate;
    }
}

// JobController.cls
public class JobController {
    public static void createJob(String title, String description) {
        Job__c newJob = new Job__c();
        newJob.Title__c = title;
        newJob.Description__c = description;
        insert newJob;
    }
}
